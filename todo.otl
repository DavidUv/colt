TODO
	[_] Add config file
		: Call it .colt and it should be searched for in current dir  
		: (to allow different settings for different dirs i.e projects) it
		: should include directives such as:
		:   ignore_dirs
		:   ignore_files
		:   key bindings (for keys: e (edit) and v (view)
	[_] Make it into a gem
	[_] Write tests (at least for ctag class)
	[_] Add help
	[_] Write simple man page
	[_] Optimize search somehow (really slow on large files, tried one with >80k tags)
